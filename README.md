# Towerman-quintus-Modified-

I'm starting to learn the framework Quintus for game design, this code was an example in the 

Quintus page (http://www.html5gametutorial.com/tutorial/game1-tower-man/) 



Due to the framework specifications, it is needed to run the program on an http server, so i coded a little web server on nodejs

in order to run it you would need to install nodejs and run the server.js file or deploy the files on another server of your choice ^^



Now the cool part :D



I coded a JS library (Laberinto.js) to generate random mazes, it uses the sub-division algorithm and replaces the static maze that came with the example.



Finally the towerman.js file has the instance of the framework and is commented either by me or the comments that are on the Quintus page.



The Goal here is to use the example to build a new game, the first step was to generate the random mazes now im going to start thinking about step 2 please fell free to play, use the code, etc



and special thanks to the Quintus team for developing this useful framework and please don't sue me for using the example XD
