# Towerman-quintus-Modified-
i'm starting to learn the framework Quintus for game design, this code was an example in the 
Quintus page (http://www.html5gametutorial.com/tutorial/game1-tower-man/) 

Due to the framework specifications, it is needed to run the program on a http server, so i coded a little web server on nodejs
in order to run it you would need to install nodejs and run the server.js file or deploy the files on another server of your choice ^^
